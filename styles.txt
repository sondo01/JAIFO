    "Sons style": " Dear XYZ,\n\n I wish you a very happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year 2024.\n\nI am currently in Vietnam for the holidays, and I am enjoying my time here. It is so nice to be back in my home country and to spend time with my family and friends.\n\nThere has not much changed from my end. I am still working at the same environment science center of the department of education. The working environment has become very toxic recently and so I'm looking for a new job now. I will let you know when I have a new job. \n\nOn your end, how are you doing? Did you have time to finish your book? Are you still in the EU? In the last email you told me that Nita was in the US, do you plan to go there or will Nita find a school in the EU to work? \n\nI hope you are having a wonderful festive season Christian and Nita!\n\nFrom Vietnam with love,\nSon\n",
    "At work": "Hi David,\nIf the file is already in Common folder then you can make the shortcut. But in this case, the file is in your own Google folder or on your laptop then the shortcut points to nowhere so it doesn't work. You need to copy or move the file to there.\nCheers,\nSon "
